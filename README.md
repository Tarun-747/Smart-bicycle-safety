# Smart Bicycle Safety Monitoring App

## Introduction
This project aims to enhance child safety during cycling by developing a smart bicycle safety monitoring application. The app utilizes smartphone sensors and GPS to monitor speed, detect falls, and track boundary crossings in real-time. It provides alerts and location updates to parents, ensuring prompt response to potential safety concerns.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Safety Monitoring**: Monitors GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope data to detect overspeed, falls, and boundary crossings.
- **Alert System**: Issues audible alerts on both the child’s and parent’s devices for overspeed and falls.
- **Emergency Response**: Activates microphone in case of a fall, sending SOS alerts with real-time audio to the parent’s device.

## System Overview
The system consists of:
- **Smartphone Sensors**: Utilizes GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope for data collection.
- **Alert Module**: Processes sensor data to trigger alerts for safety events.
- **Emergency Response Module**: Manages automatic SOS alerts and multimedia transmission.

## Implementation Details
### Sensor Data Processing
- Utilizes smartphone sensors to monitor speed, detect falls, and analyze motion patterns.
  
### Alert System
- Implements audible alerts and visual notifications for overspeed and fall events.
